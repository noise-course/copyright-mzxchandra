# **1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis**

Youtube

*How does the platform detect copyrighted content? (automated systems like Content ID, manual reporting, etc.)*

Content ID: 

Author / publisher uploads their raw audio and video, youtube in their backend creates a unique fingerprint based on the audio waveforms and visual data. So whenever someone attempts to upload something new, its fingerprint is computed and compared to existing content stored in Youtube’s DB, and if there’s a match and a violation of copyright policy, then the video gets flagged with a Content ID claim automatically.

There’s also a manual webform on Youtube Studio to submit a legal takedown request, which is then reviewed by the youtube team.

*What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?*

A Content ID claim on a video allows the copyright owner to choose to either monetize the ads revenue from the video with their content, or they can block the video from being shown on youtube, or they can just track viewership stats of the video.

For manually submitted requests, if the takedown request is valid the content is removed and a copyright strike is applied to the uploader channel

*What is the appeals or counter-notification process?*

Users can dispute a claim in Youtube Studio on the grounds of Content ID making a mistake, or license to use, or fair use argument (significant transformation), or public domain (eg. copyright expired or not eligible for protection), and then the copyright owner has 30 days to respond.

Here’s their diagram:

If a video is removed by a copyright strike the user can submit a legal Counter-Notification which youtube forwards to the claimant party, who then needs provide proof they have initiated a court action or else Youtube just allows the content to be on the platform.

*How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?*

During Content ID disputes, if both claimant and uploader want to monetize the video then the videos earn money. During the dispute the revenue is held by youtube and then once the dispute is resolved Youtube handles payouts depending on the outcome

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7000961?hl=en

But as mentioned before, if there’s a content ID claim on the video and the uploader does not dispute it then the ad revenues go to the copyright owner if they choose to monetize. In most cases all the ad revenues go to the copyright owners. Exception talked about below

*Are there any special programs (e.g., YouTube’s Content ID licensing agreements)?*

- creator music: creator buys a license for a track for some upfront cost and then they can use it and retain monetization of the video using the track
    - some tracks have revenue sharing options, so some of the revenue goes to the track’s right’s holder [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11610212?hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11610212?hl=en)

# 2. Fair use experiment

### a. Spongebob intro video, original source from nickelodeon

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pFfUunOS1a4

**Raw copyrighted clip**

Short segment was fine, just got uploaded with no claims (no restrictions)

Then I uploaded the full reel (41 seconds long), Content ID flagged it, blocked it in some regions

Time until detection = immediate

Final outcome: short segment stays up, long version gets blocked in certain regions

No additional options presented

### Content 2: Dixon Dallas songs.

**Remix or mashup**: Combine multiple sources or transform content in a creative way.

I made a mashup of the two songs, adding vocal filters like “extra bass”, “distortion”. as a result no content ID claim was put on my video, even though I used the thumbnail / visual of the original music video uploaded by dixon dallas

All were allowed

Research findings about Gemini (Veo model)

- uniqueness warning- ie. google does not guarantee that my AI outputs are unique. someone could have generated the same thing (though the way video models work this is not really practically possible)
- commercial use allowed except in violation of the prohibited use policy
    - cannot use their AI tool to violate the IP rights of others
        - so me using veo to generate a copyrighted minions characters is technically violating the prohibited use policy. But in this case I haven’t monetized it on youtube so I guess we’re fine!
- Google does not claim ownership of the content, I own the content.

Youtube’s policy on AI-generated content

- taken from Youtube’s support page: [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)
    - Creators must disclose content that:
        - Makes a real person appear to say or do something they didn’t do.
        - Alters footage of a real event or place.
        - Generates a realistic-looking scene that didn’t actually occur.
- disclosure happens from youtube studio, ‘altered content’ setting, this creates an AI label in the video’s expanded description

# 4. Legal analysis

### 4 attributes

**Spongebob intro (41-seconds raw clip)**

- **Purpose and Character:** non-transformative. exact copy of the original spongebob intro used for entertainment, serving the same media purpose as the original. no added commentary, criticism, or educational value.
- **Nature:** highly creative (animated fiction), strongest copyright protection. another point against fair use.
- **Amount:** it was 100% of the original distinct work being shared.
- **Effect on Market:** perfect market substitute, competing with Nickelodeon’s own reel on YouTube, ie. a viewer watching this reel on my channel has no reason to watch it on the official channel, losing nickolodeon income and views
- **Not Fair Use.** YouTube’s Content ID system correctly identified and blocked it

**Dixon dallas mashup (remix with audio filters)**

- **Purpose and Character:** transformative. I can argue that combining two tracks and altering the audio profile ("extra bass," "distortion") creates a new aesthetic distinct from the two originals, creating a new “mashup” entirely.
- **Nature:** Creative musical composition. Weighs against fair use.
- **Amount:** Some portions of original songs were used, altered with pitch changes etc.
- **Effect on the Market:** unlikely to serve as a substitute for the original track. Listeners looking for the original high-fidelity song would not be satisfied with this "distorted/bass-boosted" version, that cuts in and out between 2 tracks. Might end up promoting the originals.
- **Likely Fair Use.** Content ID did not detect it, suggesting that the distortion altered the audio waveform quite a bit to the point that it’s not recognizable.

### Case Law Application

- **Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (1994):**
    - rap parody of "Oh, Pretty Woman” was ruled to be fair use.
    - My dixon dallas mashup can be viewed as a creative transformation (new expression) rather than a copy, so it falls under the precedence here.
- **Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. (2021):**
    - Google used Oracle's Java API code. ruled this fair use because Google used it to create a new platform (Android), expanding the utility of the original work.
    - With my Spongebob intro, unlike Google, I didn’t reuse the work for a new functional purpose or in a different technological context—I just uploaded the entire, highly creative intro for entertainment, in the exact same market (kids/nostalgia viewers on YouTube). That’s the opposite of what Google did. so it aligns with our conclusion that my work was not fair use

### **Gap Analysis**

**Technical evasion with Content ID detection**

- Law says infringement occurs if you reproduce a work without permission, regardless of technical tricks. In the **Dixon Dallas Mashup**, I probably technically infringed on the composition rights. However, because I applied filters, the Content ID audio matching failed.
    - Enforcement on YouTube is defined by database matching. So if you alter the signature of the media enough, you could evade enforcement even if the violation is legally obvious to a human judge.
- Google’s *Prohibited Use Policy* bans using Veo to violate IP rights. I generated a video of "Minions" (protected Universal Pictures property) and was able to upload it on YouTube.
    - Content ID is currently designed to match exact audio/video files, not character likenesses so it couldn’t catch my video.

**Google’s Terms vs. Copyright Office**

- Google’s terms state that I "own" the content I generate with Veo.
- The US Copyright Office’s guidance is that an AI-generated video that lacks substantial human authorship is public domain.
